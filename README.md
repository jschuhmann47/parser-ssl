Assignment for the subject "Languages Syntax and Semantics" (Sintáxis y Semántica de los Lenguajes) where a parser and scanner was made for an invented programming language.

The language developed is similar to Micro. A program starts with the keyword `start`, ends with `end` and has variable assignation, `entrada` and `salida` (input and output) with and expression that can be either a variable or a constant with additions and substractions. 

Example valid code:

```c
start
aa=4+5-1;
entrada 45;
salida aa-90;
end
```
